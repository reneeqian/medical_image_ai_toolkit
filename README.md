# Medical Image AI Toolkit

Engineering infrastructure for developing medical imaging AI systems
under structured SaMD design principles.

---

## 1. Purpose

This repository provides reusable infrastructure for:

- Deterministic data handling
- Structured dataset objects
- Model artifact persistence
- Validation enforcement
- Evidence capture

This is an engineering toolkit — not a research notebook framework.

---

## 2. Design Principles

- Deterministic execution
- Explicit validation
- Structured requirements
- Reproducible experiment tracking
- Machine-readable traceability

## 4. Regulatory Position

This toolkit demonstrates engineering patterns aligned with
regulated AI system development. It is not a cleared device.
